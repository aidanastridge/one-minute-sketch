# ✏️ One Minute Sketch

## What?
Script that captures a random frame from youtube video.

## Why? 

One of the classic techniques for sketching the body is observing it in motion and making a quick sketch. This helps with getting comfortable perspective, space, movement, and size.

I created this script intended for electronic music videos with dancers.
